    <h2 class="heading slide-in-left">About Me</h2>
    <p> Hi, I’m a postgraduate with a strong foundation in academics and a renewed focus on building a career in technology. 
        After earning my degree in 2014, I worked as an Office Administrator from 2017 to 2019, 
        where I developed key professional skills such as organization, coordination, and attention to detail—skills 
        that I believe are just as valuable in the tech world.</p>
    <p>Recently, I’ve taken the first steps toward a career transition into IT by starting a Python programming course in VTS.
        Although I’m at the beginning of this journey, I’m deeply motivated to learn, grow, and build real-world skills.
        I’m excited to finally pursue my passion in coding more seriously.</p>
    <p>This portfolio marks the start of my learning journey. As I continue to develop my skills and gain hands-on experience, 
        I look forward to creating meaningful projects, collaborating with others, and finding opportunities where I can contribute, 
        learn, and thrive in the tech industry.</p>
